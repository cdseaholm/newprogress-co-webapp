                        This is a dashboard for the website. It is a place to manage the website and see the statistics. I understand that it might look underdeveloped at this point. It is however a work in progress. I am working on it and it will be updated soon. I only began to shift my work over from WordPress to here around March 15th. 
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-5/6">
                        Feel free to look around where you can and give me feedback. I am always looking for ways to improve the website. Otherwise check back soon for more updates!
